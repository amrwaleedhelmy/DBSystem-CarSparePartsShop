# DBSystem-CarSparePartsShop
Designed and implemented an efficient database system for a car spare parts shop, transforming a poorly structured table into a normalized, robust schema. SQL was used in this project and a PHP web page was developed to display store items, ensuring the database meets user needs and supports scalability.
